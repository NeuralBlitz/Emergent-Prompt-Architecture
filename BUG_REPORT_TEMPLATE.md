It includes **instructional comments** (hidden in the final render if used in Markdown) to guide the reporter toward providing high-quality data.

## **Best Practices for Using This Template**

1.  **One Bug, One Report:** Do not combine multiple issues into a single report. It makes tracking and closing tickets difficult.
2.  **Search First:** Before submitting, search the existing issues to ensure this hasn't already been reported.
3.  **Sanitize Data:** Ensure screenshots and logs do not contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or API keys.
