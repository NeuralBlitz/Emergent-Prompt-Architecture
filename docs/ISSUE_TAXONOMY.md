# 🏷️ The Issue Taxonomy: Classifying Intent

To manage the chaotic influx of ideas, we map every Issue to a specific location in our **Project Ontology**. This ensures that the repository remains a clean, traversable graph of work.

## **1. The Lifecycle Labels**

Every issue flows through a specific state change.

| Label | Description | Topological State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `status: seed` | New idea, unrefined. | **Potential** |
| `status: sprouting` | Under active discussion/spec. | **Forming** |
| `status: rooted` | Accepted, ready for work. | **Grounded** |
| `status: blooming` | Work in progress. | **Actuating** |
| `status: harvested` | Completed/Merged. | **Integrated** |
| `status: withered` | Closed/Rejected. | **Pruned** |

## **2. The Domain Labels**

These labels map the issue to a specific component of the **Architecture Diagram**.

*   `domain: lattice` (Knowledge Graph, Vector Database)
*   `domain: assembler` (Python Core, Logic Construction)
*   `domain: immune-system` (OmegaGuard, Safety Filters)
*   `domain: interface` (API, CLI, Bindings)
*   `domain: docs` (The Codex, READMEs)

## **3. The Priority Vector**

Priority is determined by the **Universal Flourishing Objective (UFO)**.

*   `priority: critical` (Blocks system function or safety. Immediate attention.)
*   `priority: high` (Significant value add or blocker for other features.)
*   `priority: medium` (Standard improvement.)
*   `priority: low` (Nice to have, cosmetic.)
