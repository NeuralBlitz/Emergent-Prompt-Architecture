## 🔍 The Inefficiency
<!-- What is currently suboptimal? (e.g., Complexity, Performance, Readability, Technical Debt) -->


## 🛠️ The Proposed Solution
<!-- 
Describe how you intend to refactor the code.
Include specific function names or module paths.
-->


## 📉 Risk Assessment
<!-- 
Refactoring carries the risk of regression.
Which systems rely on this code? What specific tests must be run to ensure safety?
-->


## 📊 Expected Benefits
<!-- 
- Reduced Latency?
- Improved Readability?
- Lower Memory Footprint?
-->


## 🧪 Verification Plan
<!-- How will we verify that functionality has remain unchanged (Regression Testing)? -->
```
