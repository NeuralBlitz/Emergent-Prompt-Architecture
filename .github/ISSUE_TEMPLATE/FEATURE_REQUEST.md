## 🎯 The Teleology (Why?)
<!-- 
Describe the problem you are trying to solve. 
How does this feature advance the Universal Flourishing Objective (UFO) of the EPA?
-->


## ⚙️ The Mechanism (How?)
<!-- 
Describe the technical implementation.
- Does this require new logic in the Genesis Assembler?
- Does this require new nodes in the Ontological Lattice?
- Does this require changes to the Vector Database schema?
-->


## 🕸️ Affected Components
<!-- Check all that apply -->
- [ ] **Genesis Assembler** (Core Logic)
- [ ] **Ontological Lattice** (Knowledge Graph)
- [ ] **OmegaGuard** (Safety/Immune System)
- [ ] **Ingestion Layer** (Input Processing)
- [ ] **Feedback Loop** (Reinforcement Learning)

## ⚖️ Axiomatic Safety Impact (CECT Scan)
<!-- 
CRITICAL: Could this feature be exploited to bypass safety filters?
Explain how this feature adheres to the CharterLayer Ethical Constraint Tensor (CECT).
-->


## 🧪 Acceptance Criteria
<!-- 
What does "done" look like?
1. The system can now...
2. The GoldenDAG hash validates...
3. Performance latency stays below...

#  Philosophical Rationale for These Templates**

### **Why use "Teleology" in a Feature Request?**
In standard software, features are often built because they are "cool" or "requested by a customer." In **Emergent Prompt Architecture**, features must serve a purpose. By forcing the requester to define the **Teleology** (the ultimate goal), we align the development process with the system's core axiom: **Intentionality**.

### **Why use "Risk Assessment" in Refactoring?**
EPA is a complex adaptive system. Changing a module that seems isolated (e.g., the weighting logic of an Onton) can have cascading effects on the emergent behavior of the system (e.g., causing it to become depressingly nihilistic or dangerously hallucinations). We compel the developer to think about **Second-Order Effects**.

### **Why separate "Security" from "Bugs"?**
A bug is a failure of *function*. A security vulnerability is a failure of *constraint*. In AI systems, these are fundamentally different. A bug might crash the server; a security failure might allow the AI to be manipulated into harming a user. We route security issues to a private channel to prevent **Information Hazards**.
