## 🎯 The Teleology (Why?)
<!-- 
Describe the problem you are trying to solve. 
How does this feature advance the Universal Flourishing Objective (UFO) of the EPA?
-->


## ⚙️ The Mechanism (How?)
<!-- 
Describe the technical implementation.
- Does this require new logic in the Genesis Assembler?
- Does this require new nodes in the Ontological Lattice?
- Does this require changes to the Vector Database schema?
-->


## 🕸️ Affected Components
<!-- Check all that apply -->
- [ ] **Genesis Assembler** (Core Logic)
- [ ] **Ontological Lattice** (Knowledge Graph)
- [ ] **OmegaGuard** (Safety/Immune System)
- [ ] **Ingestion Layer** (Input Processing)
- [ ] **Feedback Loop** (Reinforcement Learning)

## ⚖️ Axiomatic Safety Impact (CECT Scan)
<!-- 
CRITICAL: Could this feature be exploited to bypass safety filters?
Explain how this feature adheres to the CharterLayer Ethical Constraint Tensor (CECT).
-->


## 🧪 Acceptance Criteria
<!-- 
What does "done" look like?
1. The system can now...
2. The GoldenDAG hash validates...
3. Performance latency stays below...
-->


## 🔗 Additional Context
<!-- Add sketches, code snippets, or reference links here. -->
